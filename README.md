# ScriptableTemplate

I have used this for creating classic ASP web pages which follow the same structure and have a lot of repeated code, by using templates and a C# class per produced per .asp file.

I have also used this for generating statically parameterisable SQL stored procedures and views which share the same concepts and repeated code that have the performance benefits of inline code as opposed to having the repeated code in sub-SQL functions.
